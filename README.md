## Acquire
HistFitter has 2 stable versions, one complient with Python2 (v0.66.0) and one with Python3 (v1.x.y).
If you're going to be using HistFitter directly as a standalone application, clone the latest stable release. The Python2 version is no longer being updated.

```
git clone https://github.com/histfitter/histfitter
git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X
```
This creates a folder named histfitter with the source code.

If you're using HistFitter as a submodule in a project, specify the latest stable release while adding the submodule

```
# Relative path gives nicer clones in CI if parent project on CERN's GitLab
git submodule add ../../HistFitter/HistFitter.git
cd HistFitter && git checkout vX.XX.X -b vX.XX.X && cd ..
git add HistFitter && git commit -m "Add HistFitter submodule"
```


### Recommended Root version

Recommended Root version is 6.28/00. This version of HistFitter is not compatible with ROOT versions < 6.28.

An LCG release with the correct ROOT and Python versions can be loaded with

```
source setup_lcg.sh
```

## Build

Make your build directory and specify install directory. You have to point cmake to where the cloned source directory is located.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/ /path/to/histfitter/
make -j4 install
```

HistFitter was originally built and used in the same folder as the source code. If you prefer this option, simply go to the source folder and make the build directory there. This will treat the source code folder `histfitter` as the install location, creating the /lib folder directly there.
```
cd histfitter
mkdir build
cd build
cmake  ..
make install
```
This will create a lib folder with the installed libraries.


## Setup

The environment must be set by activating the setup script, located in the /install folder, in the directory where you want to work. This will create three new folders in your work folder: /config /data and /results. It also copies the `HistFactorySchema.dtd` file over to the config folder. Most importantly, the setup script sets the environment variable paths which are required for the scripts to work. The paths are set during install, and if any folders are moved, the build and install process must be rerun to update the setup script.

```
source /path/to/install/histfitter_setup.sh
```

## Workflow

See the tutorial.

## Directory structure source code

- `analysis`: Contains all files related to an analysis. E.g. `ZeroLepton/`
- `doc`: Documentation
- `examples`: Example scripts that use the libraries in `python/`
- `lib`: Location shared library
- `macros`: Macros for making plots, testing the fit, ongoing work, etc
- `python`: Python base classes
- `scripts`: Scripts for making workspaces based on text files in data/ . Scripts for submitting batch jobs.
- `src`: Source code to make workspaces, do toys.
- `test`: pytest tests

## Directory structure working folder

- `config` : Contains HistFactory schema
- `results`: Where root files with workspaces generated by HistFactory get stored- `config`: Contains HistFactory schema
- `data`: Contains data text files, provided externally, used to create workspaces for analysis

## Contributing

To contribute to development please first fork HistFitter and do all of your development on a feature branch that is **not** `master`.
If you are planning on making feature changes please first [open up an Issue](https://github.com/histfitter/histfitter/issues) and outline your plans so that development can be discusses with the maintainer team, streamlining the process as your MR is written.

When you make a MR, include a summary in the body of the MR of your changes that can be easily found and incorporated into Changelog for the next release.
